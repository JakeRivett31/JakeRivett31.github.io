        <h5>Accessibility of vital resources is a major global issue that causes mass poverty and hunger in many countries today. Hunger is prevalent in many countries, as was indicated by the Global Hunger index (GHI). This hunger causes malnourishment in children and leads to an increase in child mortality rates and other unnecessary deaths. And, although not directly related to hunger, there is also a worldwide water crisis. Not only is this drinking water but also water that helps grow plants for food, and water for sanitation and cleaning purposes. Over the course of this page, you will discover just how hungry this world is and how little access some countries have to food. Overall, the effects of undernourishment.</h5>

        <h3>Undernourishment</h3>
        <h6 class="UndernourishmentTypes">There are two basic types of malnutrition/undernutrition. The first and most important is protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), or a lack of calories and protein. Food is converted into energy by humans, and the energy contained in food is measured by calories. Protein is necessary for key body functions, including the development and maintenance of muscles. Protein-energy malnutrition is the more lethal form of malnutrition/hunger and is the type of malnutrition that is referred to when world hunger is discussed. This leads to growth failure.</h6>
